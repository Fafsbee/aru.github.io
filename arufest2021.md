# AruFest 2021

## When?

_Officially_ February 13, but @aru will be online all weekend. Starting February 13 UTC 00:00. Up until February 15 UTC 24:00

## UTC what?
Here is a handy [link](https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/?pl=1&lid=100,3530597,2643743,3117735&h=100&date=2/13/2021%7C3&hf=1) I prepared for this exact same question. Please check your timezone. As I live in Mexico, the _main day_ I expect people to be online will be February 13 UTC-6 (my time). But you can catch me all weekend.

## Where?

100% Online. Keep on reading to get an invite.

## How?

@aru will try to do _some_ magic and leverage the following technologies to stream directly to you:
- Zoom
- Discord
- Twitch
- Google Hangouts
- Mozilla Hubs
- YouTube
- Steam Remote Play

### This sounds chaotic.

Yes! It will be. That will be part of the fun. We will also have games. 

### Games? Which Games?

Through the magic of the Internet I can stream any game I own directly to you. However, I have a _secret agenda_, and it IS my birthday, so here are some games we are guaranteed to play:
1. Beat Hazard 2 (with my music)
2. Puyo Puyo Tetris
3. Gensou Skydrift
4. Cake Bash
5. Just Shapes and Beats
6. Moving Out
7. Overcooked 2
8. Super Indie Karts

### Okay, what do I need to play?

_Technically_ you don't need anything but a couple of apps/accounts to play. We can play all of the above games through even the most _potato_ phones out there provided you have:
1. A Steam Account
2. The Steam Link app installed
3. The Steam Chat app installed

Your phone can act like a virtual Xbox 360 controller and you can play any of the above games with me. If you live very far away please _do expect some lag_. This will also be "part of the fun".

If you already have an Xbox 360 controller (or similar). We can play _even more games_ through the magic of Parsec. Provided you have it installed and have an account.

Some of the games I want to play through Parsec are:

1. Octodad
2. Rabi-rabi
3. NintendoLand
4. Mario Kart Double Dash

### These games aren't really my jam, could we play ____________ (something else)?

If I like it and enough people are up for it, yes!

### Do we really have to play on a phone/PC?
No! We can also play on consoles. I have console games too. We can play Mario Kart for Switch. Or Splatoon. Or Among Us. Just talk me into it.

### What else will be happening?
We will also be watching anime whenever I feel like it. Like when I need to sleep, for example. There might be some other surprises as well. DO STAY TUNED!

### I'm still not engaged
I will also be gifting games _directly to you_. Raffles! Payola! I will sing for you. _Not everything might be free_.

### Anything else I should bring?

There are a couple of games I _want_ to play but are challenging to play online. Mainly because I need you to own one of these:

I don't want to impose on anybody, and I am 110% perfectly fine just playing on my own while on stream. The following rules will apply:

# Rules
1. No need to show your face, no webcam needed, but please say 'Hi' if you join voice comms. I won't bite. I am, as a fact, more afraid of human interaction than you.
2. No need to play. As stated above.
3. No need to gift me anything. Guilt-free party!
4. Be Nice. Only the purest 110% best-est of vibes.
