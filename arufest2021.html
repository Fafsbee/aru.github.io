# AruFest 2021 (ONLINE EDITION)

## When?

_Officially_ February 13, but @aru will be online all weekend. Starting February 13 UTC 00:00. Up until February 15 UTC 24:00

## UTC what?
Here is a handy [link](https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/?pl=1&lid=100,3530597,2643743,3117735&h=100&date=2/13/2021%7C3&hf=1) I prepared for this exact same question. Please check your timezone. As I live in Mexico, the _main day_ I expect people to be online will be February 13 UTC-6 (my time). But you can catch me all weekend.

## Where?

100% Online. Keep on reading to get an invite.

## How?

@aru will try to do _some_ magic and leverage the following technologies to stream directly to you (in this order of priority):
- Discord (invite needed, I will kick you afterwards dw)
- Mozilla Hubs (invite also needed)
- Steam Remote Play (we need to be friends, sign-up below)
- Zoom (for extended friends and people who don't want to install Discord/Steam)
- Google Hangouts (for family and people who can't use anything else)
- Twitch (if you just want to chat)
- YouTube (if Twitch fails)

### This sounds chaotic.

Yes! It will be. That will be part of the fun. We will also have games. 

### Games? Which Games?

Through the magic of the Internet I can stream any game I own directly to you. However, I have a _secret agenda_, and it IS my birthday, so here are some games we are guaranteed to play:
1. [Beat Hazard 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/618740/Beat_Hazard_2/) (with my music, ofc, but I can take requests) 
2. [Puyo Puyo Tetris](https://store.steampowered.com/app/546050/Puyo_PuyoTetris/)
3. [Gensou Skydrift](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1065260/GENSOU_Skydrift/)
4. [Cake Bash](https://store.steampowered.com/app/971690/Cake_Bash/)
5. [Just Shapes and Beats](https://store.steampowered.com/app/531510/Just_Shapes__Beats/)
6. [Moving Out](https://store.steampowered.com/app/996770/Moving_Out/)
7. [Overcooked 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/728880/Overcooked_2/)
8. [Super Indie Karts](https://store.steampowered.com/app/323670/Super_Indie_Karts/)
9. [Pummel Party](https://store.steampowered.com/app/880940/Pummel_Party/)

### Okay, what do I need to play?

_Technically_ you don't need anything but a couple of apps/accounts to play. We can play all of the above games through even the most _potato_ phones out there provided you have:
1. A Steam Account, get one [here](https://www.steampowered.com).
2. The Steam Link app installed [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.valvesoftware.steamlink&hl=en&gl=US) [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/steam-chat/id1434890245)
3. The Steam Chat app installed [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.valvesoftware.android.steam.friendsui&hl=en&gl=US) [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/steam-link/id1246969117)

Your phone can act like a virtual Xbox 360 controller and you can play any of the above games with me. If you live very far away please _do expect some lag_. This will also be "part of the fun".

If you already have an Xbox 360 controller (or similar) and you don't want to play on a phone, we can play on the Steam app for PC/Mac/Linux(wow)!

We can play _even more games_ through the magic of [Parsec](https://parsec.app/). Provided you have it installed and have an account.

Some of the games I want to play through Parsec are:

1. Octodad
2. Rabi-rabi
3. NintendoLand
4. Mario Kart Double Dash

### These games aren't really my jam, could we play ____________ (something else)?

If I like it and enough people are up for it, yes!

### Do we really have to play on a phone/PC?
No! We can also play on consoles. I have console games too. We can play Mario Kart for Switch. Or Splatoon. Or Among Us. Just talk me into it.

### What else will be happening?
We will also be watching anime whenever I feel like it. Like when I need to sleep, for example. There might be some other surprises as well. DO STAY TUNED!

### I'm still not engaged
I will also be gifting games _directly to you_. Raffles! Payola! Coaching. I will sing for you. The possibilities are endless and entirely up to me. _NOTE: Not everything might be free_

### Anything else I should bring?

There are a couple of games I _want_ to play but are challenging to play online. Mainly because I need you to own one of these:

I don't want to impose on anybody, and I am 110% perfectly fine just playing on my own while on stream. The following rules will apply:

# Rules
1. No need to show your face, no webcam needed, but please say 'Hi' if you join voice comms. I won't bite. I am, as a fact, more afraid of human interaction than you.
2. No need to play. As stated above.
3. No need to gift me anything. Guilt-free party!
4. Be Nice. Only the purest 110% best-est of vibes.
