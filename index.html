I installed rustup in my NAS via the following command:
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
now I will try to install the anki server.
I had to source the $HOME/.cargo/env file like so;
```
source ~/.cargo/env
```
and then I was able to just do this:
```
cargo install --git https://github.com/ankitects/anki.git --tag 24.06.3 anki-sync-server
```
This did not work because it failed to compile libc, what I did was install entware via app central in the asustor settings, after that I could do:
```
opkg update
opkg install gcc
```
and after that, hopefully I will be able to do the cargo install command, we shall see. OK, I got another error? warning? message at the end:
```
There are no *-dev packages in Entware(with few exceptions)!
Please install headers as described in the wiki:
https://github.com/Entware/Entware/wiki
```
I also had to install protobuf:
```
opkg install protobuf
```
and then I had to set the PROTOC environment variable:
```
export PROTOC=/volume1/anki/protoc/bin/protoc
```
and then finally I was able to do this:
```
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/cargo-installw0U97l cargo install --git https://github.com/ankitects/anki.git --tag 24.06.3 anki-sync-server
```
actually, no, I ran out of space in `/tmp` so I had to move that to
```
/volume1/anki/cargo-install
```
and then I was able to do: 
```
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/volume1/anki/cargo-install cargo install --git https://github.com/ankitects/anki.git --tag 24.06.3 anki-sync-server
```
which is not as straightforward as it seems.
Now that everything is installed we can do:
```
SYNC_USER1=aru:aru anki-sync-server
```
In the future you can create a script in `/etc/init.d/anki-server-sync` and create a script like this:
```
#!/bin/sh

export SYNC_USER1=user:pass
DAEMON=/usr/local/bin/anki-sync-server
LOGFILE=/var/log/anki-sync-server.log

case "$1" in
    start)
        echo "Starting Anki Sync Server"
        $DAEMON > $LOGFILE 2>&1 &
        ;;
    stop)
        echo "Stopping Anki Sync Server"
        pkill -f $DAEMON
        ;;
    restart)
        $0 stop
        $0 start
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop|restart}"
        exit 1
        ;;
esac

exit 0
```
Next week we should try to do this one:
[obsidian-livesync/docs/quick_setup.md at main Â· vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync (github.com)](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync/blob/main/docs/quick_setup.md)

OK I rebooted the NAS and it cleared the script from `/etc/init.d`, you should install it in `/usr/local/etc/init.d/` instead as per the internet:
